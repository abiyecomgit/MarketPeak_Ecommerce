## Capstone Project-Introduction to Cloud Computing

**Capstone Project: E-Commerce Platform Deployment with Git, Linux, and AWS**


# Project Instructions:

I'v been assigned to develope an e-commerce website for a new online marketplace named "MarketPeak." This platform will feature product listings, a shopping cart, and user authentication. To implement this project I will be using Git for version control, the develpoment platform will be in a Linux environment, and deploy it on an AWS EC2 instance. You can find a suitable website template here to kickstart your development

# Tasks

1: Implement Version Control with Git

1.1. Initialize Git Repository: Create the project directory or folder and name it "MarketPeak_Ecommerce". then cd into the new project directory and ini it as a git repository.

Below commands was used:

`mkdir MarketPeak_Ecommerce`

`cd MarketPeak_Ecommerce`

`git init`


# 1.2. Obtain and Prepare the E-Commerce Website Template:

 As a DevOps Engineer, I don't have to develope the website code, that work is for web/software developers. Instead of developing the website from scratch, I will use a pre- existing e-commerce website template.

Download a Website Template: Visit (Tooplate)[https://www.tooplate.com/] or any other free template resource, and download a suitable e-commerce website template. Look for templates that are ready to use and require minimal adjustments. It is recommended you download the specific template
